TYPO3\FLOW3\Tests\Functional\AOP\AopProxy
 [x] Advices are executed again if an overridden method calls its parent method
 [x] Method arguments with value null are passed to the proxied method

TYPO3\FLOW3\Tests\Functional\AOP\Framework

 [x] Contain with spl object storage in runtime evaluation
 [x] Constructor advices are invoked
 [x] Advice information is also built when the target class is unserialized
 [x] After returning advice is taking effect
 [x] Code after the aop code in the proxy method is only called once
 [x] Protected methods can also be adviced
 [x] Result of greet object method is modified by advice
 [x] This is supported in method runtime condition
